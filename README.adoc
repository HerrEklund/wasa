= Wasa

Wasa is a concept for a fully online board-game platform. Wasa explores how modern web technologies can enable
board games to be enjoyed on modern platforms such as touch devices as well as on large-screen PCs.

*Disclaimer!* Wasa is not a fully working board game solution. It is a project made to explore
how real time web-based touch-interface gaming could work. It is a work in process.

== Features

What makes Wasa different from other component based board-game (online or not) solutions:

* Web based solution - works on any platform.
* *Mobile first* Must work great on touch-screens such as smartphones or iPads.
* Quick access - One link to start, view or continue game.
* Live experience (if wanted), everything is instantly seen by other players.
* No files.
* Generic - Wasa focuses on component movement and interactions, less on specific game rules.

The draw-back is of course that players must know the rules and there is no automatic score/resource counting etc.

== Target games

The content below serves as a demo for the concept and will be updated along the way. While features are added
continuously, Wasa aims to implement games with the following characteristics at this time:

* Complex wargames (ie. tries to handle stacks of components, component flipping, rotation etc).
* No hidden informations right now (ie no decks of cards, no bags with chits, no hidden tokens, no block games)</li>

=== Features working

All features are implemented with touch support first in mind (must work great on both PCs and iPads etc.).

* State synchronization between multiple browsers!
* In-game chat.
* Current game history loaded when first entering game.
* Two-sided counters (flip by long click).
* Component trays.
* Multiple game sessinos active (even for a single game).
* Draggable markers.
* Counter move animations.
* Rotatable markers (if enabled and useful).
* Markers move to top when moved (ie. for stacking).
* Stack selection (select all overlapping).
* Peek into stacks.
* Game components can be marked using a colored border.
* Draggable panels (Tray, game board etc.)

=== Major features currently in development</h4>

* Simple Game lobby (select or create new private game)

=== Cool features in investigation or development</h4>

* Turn concept (ie. lock board of others while acting in your turn).
* Offline mode (stack events locally until connection is made).

== Technical

=== Front-end

* HTML5
* "Standard" Bootstrap / Jquery(UI) solution
* Websocket event notification for instant and no page refresh experience.

=== Back-end

Very simple at this point. Based on Redis for event storage and notification.
