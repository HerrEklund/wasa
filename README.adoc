= Wasa

Wasa is a concept for a fully online board-game platform. Wasa explores how modern web technologies can enable
advanced board games, such as classical chit-based war games, to be enjoyed on touch devices as well as on large-screen PCs.

*Disclaimer!* Wasa is not a fully working board game solution. It is a project made to explore how real time web-based
touch-interface gaming could work. It is a work in process.

== Goals

=== Primary goals
* Online multiplayer games.
* Share game by sharing a single link.
* No files to share or no emails to send during the game.
* Live experience if wanted (preferrably using voice or video conference as support function).
* Full history of all game events.
* Fast, browser based solution.
* No client installation.
* Generic. Focus on component movement and interactions, less on specific game rules.

=== Secondary goals
* Designed with touch devices (smartphones, ipads)  in mind.

== Limitations

Wasa aims to implement games with the following characteristics at this time:

* Complex wargames (ie. tries to handle stacks of components, component flipping, rotation etc).
* No hidden informations right now (ie no decks of cards, no bags with chits, no hidden tokens, no block games)

== Features
All features are implemented with touch support first in mind (must work great on both PCs and iPads etc.).


=== Features working
Below is just a take-out of what works:

* State synchronization between multiple browsers.
* Multiple game sessions active (even for a single game).
* In-game chat.
* Current game history loaded when first entering game.
* Two-sided counters (flip by long click).
* Component trays, grouped.
* Draggable markers.
* Counter move animations.
* Rotatable markers (if enabled and useful).
* Markers move to top when moved (ie. for stacking).
* Stack selection (select all overlapping).
* Highlighting of components.
* Peek into stacks.
* Game components can be marked using a colored border.
* Draggable panels (Tray, game board etc.)

=== Features currently in development

* Stack movement.

=== Ideas

* Undo or back/forward in history.
* Turn concept (ie. lock board of others while acting in your turn).
* Offline mode (stack events locally until connection is made).

== Technical

=== Overview
TODO: Add figure showing how stuff fits together.

Application fundamentals:

1. application/index.html is loaded by the browser.

1. from the document.ready() function nunjucks.js is configured and then createWasaBoardGame() is executed.

1. createWasaBoardGame sets up the back-end client and check for email, session ids and stuff.

1. after a while, the GUI is created through initWasaFront()


=== Front-end

* HTML5
* "Standard" Bootstrap / Jquery(UI) solution
* Websocket event notification for instant and no page refresh experience.

=== Back-end

Very simple at this point. Based on Redis for event storage and notification.
