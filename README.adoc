= Wasa

Wasa is a concept for a fully online board-game platform. Wasa explores how modern web technologies can enable
advanced board games, such as classical chit-based war games, to be enjoyed on touch devices as well as on large-screen PCs.

*Disclaimer!* Wasa is not a fully working board game solution. It is a project made to explore how real time web-based
touch-interface gaming could work. It is a work in process.

== Goals

=== Primary goals
* Online multiplayer games.
* Share game by sharing a single link.
* No files to share or no emails to send during the game.
* Live experience if wanted (preferrably using voice or video conference as support function).
* Full history of all game events.
* Fast, browser based solution.
* No client installation.
* Generic. Focus on component movement and interactions, less on specific game rules.

=== Secondary goals
* Designed with touch devices (smartphones, ipads)  in mind.

_GMT Games France 40, by Mark Simonitch, based on the Vassal Module._

== Limitations

Wasa aims to implement games with the following characteristics at this time:

* Complex wargames (ie. tries to handle stacks of components, component flipping, rotation etc).
* No hidden informations right now (ie no decks of cards, no bags with chits, no hidden tokens, no block games)

== Features
All features are implemented with touch support first in mind (must work great on both PCs and iPads etc.).


=== Features working
Below is just a take-out of what works:

* State synchronization between multiple browsers.
* Multiple game sessions active (even for a single game).
* In-game chat.
* Current game history loaded when first entering game.
* Two-sided counters (flip by long click).
* Component trays, grouped.
* Draggable markers.
* Counter move animations.
* Rotatable markers (if enabled and useful).
* Markers move to top when moved (ie. for stacking).
* Stack selection (select all overlapping).
* Highlighting of components.
* Peek into stacks.
* Game components can be marked using a colored border.
* Draggable panels (Tray, game board etc.)

=== Features currently in development

* Stack movement.

=== Ideas

* Undo or back/forward in history.
* Turn concept (ie. lock board of others while acting in your turn).
* Offline mode (stack events locally until connection is made).

== Technical

=== Overview
TODO: Add figure showing how stuff fits together.

Application fundamentals:

1. application/index.html is loaded by the browser.

1. from the document.ready() function nunjucks.js is configured and then createWasaBoardGame() is executed.

1. createWasaBoardGame sets up the back-end client and check for email, session ids and stuff.

1. after a while, the GUI is created through initWasaFront()


=== Front-end
A good thing to always take in mind is that Wasa, just as Vassal, works with game component as pictures and pixels and
not as scalable objects. All objects are placed by absolute position. This means, that whenever a module is implemented,
all components and movements are done by chaing the absolute X/Y coordinate. So, the game map can not be replaced, or re-scaled
without resetting all games (or possible converting existing games to the new scale, not implemented yet).

* HTML5
* "Standard" Bootstrap / Jquery(UI) solution
* Websocket event notification for instant and no page refresh experience.

=== Back-end

Very simple at this point. Based on Redis for event storage and notification.

== HOWTO

=== Convert Vassal Moule to Wasa Moule
Converting a (modern) Vassal module to a Wasa module is fairly straight forward. It can be done by a person not skilled
in programming, but will probably go a lot faster if you are able to edit some simple scripts that will better match
the Vassal module in question.

Follow the example below, where I convert the Holland ´44 game to a Wasa module, step by step to get the picture.

This game contain no cards, and that step is not yet explained since cards are not fully implemented yet.

==== Preparing the source files
1. Download the Vassal module somwhere around http://www.vassalengine.org/wiki/Category:Modules[here].

1. Use your normal un-ZIP program of choice (The ".vmod"-file is actually just a zip-file), to un-zip the file at a
temporary place.

1. Open up the folder containing the un-Zipped Vassal module.

1. Inside it you will find a sub-folder named 'images'. Open it.

1. This directory should contain a hand-full of large files (the game map and player aids), and probably a lot more
smaller files - the chits/counters and/or the cards of the game. Keep the window open until later.

==== Creating the new game module
Creating a new game module takes 20-30 min for the basics. But touch up the components and setting up scenarios varies
a lot from game to game.

Best method is to just copy the most similar module found. Most modules are actually very similar in structure. But
two good modules to use as a starting-point would be Red Winter or France 40. Lets go for France 40 since it is a game
of the same series.

https://github.com/HerrEklund/wasa/tree/master/application/game_modules

1. From the wasa sources (clone using git, or just https://github.com/HerrEklund/wasa/archive/master.zip[download them as a ZIP-file].

1. If ZIP-download, unpack the sources and go to wasa/applicatin/game_modules/ and copy the france_40 folder and
rename the copy to holland_44. This name also doubles as the game module ID used URLs later on.

1. Now, we need to clean out the France 40 components. Remove everything inside "components".

1. Copy the entire 'images' folder of the Hollad 44 vassal module to the "components" directory you just cleaned. After
copying it, rename the directory 'images' to 'vassal'.

1. Back in the 'holland_44' folder, open up the file config.js and edit the fields under "game_data" (leave everythin
above unchanged for now):

It should look something like below:

    var game_data = {
        //
        // Game id and directory name under "game_modules"
        'game_id': 'holland_44',
        //
        // Whatever you like
        'version': '0.1a',
        //
        // Textual tile, used to present the game
        'title': 'Holland 44',
        //
        // A sub tile is common, fill it in if applicable
        'subtitle': 'Operation Market-Garden',
        //
        // Path ot the box front. Used for presenting the game
        'box_front_img': 'components/vassal/Holland44 Cover Scaled.png',
        //
        // Leave this as default
        'component_path_prefix': 'components/vassal/',
        //
        // A custom CSS class that will be applied to all counters of this game
        //
        // This class is defined in the file style.css (more about that below)
        'component_classes': 'holland44_counter_small',
        //
        // This structure defines the "tabs" of the game. There are three classes of tabs:
        // 1) Game maps, on which game components can be dropped
        //   Note that map boards do not define their game image at this point.
        //   (it is done in the style.css file)
        'game_board_tabs': [
            {
                'title': 'Main map',
                'id': 'main_map',
                'classes': ''
            }
        ],
        // 2) Non game-maps, like tables and Player Aids
        //   At this point look inside the "components/vassal" directory and look for the few big files:
        //   Note, that you need to set the correct width in pixles for each image.
        //   If you want, you could add more tabs (images) by adding new blocks similar to the one below.
        'extra_tabs': [
            {
                'title': 'Player Aid',
                'id': 'tab2',
                'image_src': 'components/vassal/HO44-PAC-FINAL-HiRes-1 100.jpg',
                'image_style': 'width: 1100px; height: auto;'
            },
            {
                'title': 'Terrain effects',
                'id': 'tab3',
                'image_src': 'components/vassal/HO44-PAC-FINAL-HiRes-2 100.jpg',
                'image_style': 'width: 1100px; height: auto;'
            },
        ],
        // 3) Rules. This tab does not display the rules, but simply a link to the rules.
        //    you can often find a link to the game rules using Google.
        'rules_tab': {
            'id': 'rules_tab',
            'link_src': 'https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gmtwebsiteassets/Holland44/HO44-LIVINGRULES-May2018.pdf',
            'link_title': 'Official rules by GMT'
        },
        // You will add the scenarios at a later point. You could keep the "scenarios" field empty for now.
        'scenarios': [
        ]
    };

==== Style.js
This file contains the play board definitions as well as some custom CSS for this particular game.

The IDs of the game boards above (in config.js) must each appear here. So we need include main_map
as well as normandy44_counter_small and add the correct sizes for the big map and the small counters.

You could customize the component class as well to give each component some more space in the component tray
for example.

    #main_title {
    }
    .theme_color {
        color: #b2392e;
    }
    .custom_game_table {
        padding: 150px;
        padding-bottom: 500px;
    }
    #tab_side {
        /* Most of the times, keep it to relative (large maps). Some small maps could use fixed though */
        position: relative;
    }
    #main_map {
        background-image: url('components/vassal/HOLLAND44_Map-nf.jpg');
        height: 6528px;
        width: 3300px;
    }
    .component {
        float: left;
        cursor: pointer;
        border-radius: 6px;
    }
    .holland44_counter_small {
        /* Custom for this game */
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        width: 85px;
        height: 85px;
    }

==== Creating the components.js file
The components.js file defines what usable and placeable components are available in each game.

This file _can_ be created by hand, but can much faster be partly generated by a small python-script and then instead
tidied up by hand, whatever details the script could not automatically set up.

Most game module contains a script called "generate_wasa_components_js.py". Have a look at them. The script is quite
simple as it just scans through the images-directory (under "components/vassal"). It filters out the large files and
possibly also very small files, or files not matching a certain naming-scheme etc.

The goal is to create a file called components.js. In its simplest form it looks like the one below:

    var component_list = [
        '12VA.ex.png',
        '12VA.png',
        '13PA.ex.png',
        '13PA.png',
        '17VA.ex.png',
        '17VA.png',
        '1CT.ex.png',
        ];

However, Wasa supports a slightly more rich structure. And the generation-script of later modules (like France 40) instead
generates a file that looks like this (shortened to save some space), which is much more useful, but also a bit tougher
to generate. The Normandy 44-game contains over 600 different sides (300+ front and back) to pair up.

The big deal is that the script can detect the front- and back-sides of the components and create the
pairs of images as seen below. But note, that some components may not be correctly detected in full, and so to make
the Wasa module be correct. Some manual labour is often needed.

The script could very well be re-written in a more general and more useful manner. I did not spend much time on this
part.

Also note, that the components are roughly categorized, where the first item of each list (the [] brackets) containing
the header of each category:

    var component_list = [
        [
            "Belgic",
            ["be-16div", {"b": "BE-16Div-Bk.png", "f": "BE-16Div.png"}],
            ["be-17div", {"b": "BE-17Div-Bk.png", "f": "BE-17Div.png"}],
            ["be-18div", {"b": "BE-18Div-Bk.png", "f": "BE-18Div.png"}],
            ["be-1cav", {"b": "BE-1Cav-Bk.png", "f": "BE-1Cav.png"}],
        ],
        [
            "British",
            ["br-12div", {"b": "BR-12Div-Bk.png", "f": "BR-12Div.png"}],
            ["br-12l-recon", {"f": "BR-12L-recon.png"}],
            ["br-1div", {"b": "BR-1DIV-Bk.png", "f": "BR-1Div.png"}],
        ],
        [
            "French",
            ["fr-101-84", {"b": "FR-101-84-Bk.png", "f": "FR-101-84.png"}],
            ["fr-101-87", {"b": "FR-101-87-Bk.png", "f": "FR-101-87.png"}],
            ["fr-102-148", {"b": "FR-102-148-Bk.png", "f": "FR-102-148.png"}],
            ["fr-102-42", {"b": "FR-102-42-Bk.png", "f": "FR-102-42.png"}],
            ["fr-tkbn-6", {"f": "FR-TkBn-6.png"}],
            ["fr-tkbn-7", {"f": "FR-TkBn-7.png"}],
            ["fr-tkbn-9", {"f": "FR-TkBn-9.png"}],
        ],
        [
            "Germans",
            ["ge-1", {"b": "GE-1-Bk.png", "f": "GE-1.png"}],
            ["ge-10", {"b": "GE-10-Bk.png", "f": "GE-10.png"}],
            ["ge-11", {"b": "GE-11-Bk.png", "f": "GE-11.png"}],
            ["ge-11sch", {"b": "GE-11Sch-B.png", "f": "GE-11Sch-F.png"}],
            ["ge-ssrem", {"b": "GE-SSREM-B.png"}],
            ["ge-ssrem-a", {"f": "GE-SSREM-A.png"}],
            ["ge-sstot", {"b": "GE-SSTot-B.png", "f": "GE-SSTot.png"}],
            ["ge-ssverf", {"b": "GE-SSVerf-B.png", "f": "GE-SSVerf.png"}],
        ],
        [
            "Misc",
            ["m-autods", {"f": "m-AutoDS.png"}],
            ["m-control-allied", {"f": "m-CONTROL-Allied.png"}],
            ["m-train", {"f": "m-Train.png"}],
            ["m-turn", {"f": "m-Turn-GE.png", "b": "m-Turn-Allied.png"}],
        ]
    ];

So to get started with the often small modifications needed, it is allways a good idea too look at the images directory
and find out if the front- and back-sides seem to follow a common pattern. The images for the back-side of the
counters are often named with a suffice like '-b' or '-back' for example. In Holland 44, the module uses '-f' for
the front and '-b' for the backs.

I only modified a part of the script in the middle of the iteration over the directories:

    back_suffixes = ['-r.png']
    front_suffixes = ['-f.png', '.png']
    c_key = get_c_key(file_name, back_suffixes)
    if c_key:
        component = component_map.get(c_key, {})
        component['b'] = file_name
    else:
        c_key = get_c_key(file_name, front_suffixes)
        component = component_map.get(c_key, {})
        component['f'] = file_name

And then run the script once to generate the first components.js. I then manually added a default header
such as "All" to make it follow the grouped structure seen above.

Now, the manual labour takes place. But wait with this until the module loads correctly, since it is very useful
to load and see all components and the errors.

==== Registering the new game module
Before the new game module shows up in the game directory, it needs to be registered in a separate file.

Open up **wasa/application/game_modules/registered_modules.js**

I now add a the new entry below somewhere close to France 40:

    {
        'game_id': 'holland_44',
        'title': 'Holland \'44',
        'subtitle': 'Operation Market-Garden',
        'box_front': './game_modules/holland_44/components/vassal/Holland44 Cover Scaled.png',
        'comment': 'Partially working.'
    },

I should be able to use the new module by surfing to the lobby, seeing the game box appear:

image:/img/doc/new_game_added.png[Holland 44]


==== Testing and debugging.
At this point, chances are a few things are not fully correctly set-up. If the module does not load correctly. Make
sure to keep an eye on the browser console for any errors. Common errors I have encounted are:

* Miss-spelled paths.
* Failed to update some fields when I copy and pasted another module.
* Wrong format of the components.js, a missing comma for example.


==== Correcting generated components
Now, after the module loads correctly, you will need to look through the component tray and update the generated file
with better pairs of fronts and backs. You could at this point alsow categorize the components into suitable groups,
such as by faction or component types etc.


==== Setting up scenarios / starting positions
After the components was improved and verified. It is time for the last and most fun part before the module is ready.

This step is fairly straight forward.

1. Reset the game by clicking on the "Session" tap of the Player Panel.
1. Then follow the scenario set-up instructions of the game to place all components.
1. Verify the set-up. For complex games, it is easy to make misstakes.
1. After all components are correctly placed, go to the chat-window and type

    /dump

You will be presented with a window containing all data needed for the set-up. Something like this:

    /* Events from game_id = holland_44 */
    [
      {
        "event_type": "dice_roll",
        "username": "herr.eklund",
        "time": 1539725790,
        "payload": {
          "dice_rolled": "1D6",
          "result": 1
        }
      },
      {
        "event_type": "create_component",
        "username": "herr.eklund",
        "time": 1539726241,
        "payload": {
          "tray_component_id": "us-101-502-1-para-inf-bttn",
          "component_id": "blc5d2cq",
          "game_board_id": "main_map",
          "left": 458.6666564941406,
          "top": 890.0208129882812,
          "flipped": true
        }
      },

Copy and paste the contents into a new file under *normandy_44/scenarios*. Prepend the list of events with

 var scenario_setup =
