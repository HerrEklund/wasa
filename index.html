    <h2>Wasa <small>web based multiplayer board game concept</small></h2>
    <p class="lead">
        Wasa is a concept for a fully online board-game platform. Wasa explores how modern web technologies can enable
        classic board games to be enjoyed on modern platforms such as touch devices as well as on large-screen PCs.
    </p>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>What makes Wasa different from other board-game (online or not) solutions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Web based solution - works on any platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile first</strong> - Must work great on touch-screens such as smartphones or iPads</li>
        <li>Quick access - One link to start or continue game.</li>
        <li>Live movements, everything is instantly seen by other players.</li>
        <li>Generic - Wasa focuses on component movement and interactions, less on specific game rules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The draw-back is of course that players must know the rules and there is no automatic score/resource counting etc.</p>

    <h3>Technical stuff</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"Standard" Bootstrap / Jquery(UI) solution</li>
        <li>Websocket event notification for instant and no page refresh experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The backend is based on a Redis database which the HTML5/Javascript client interacts with. The security comes
    from client-side generated Keys to create and find games as well as client side generated public and private key-pairs.</p>

    <p>Game observers can listen for updates by knowing the public key of the game. Only players can update the game
    state using a shared secret game-key. When players update the game state (by moving a piece or rolling a die) they sign
    the events using the private message key (not same as the secret game-key). Other players as well as observers of
    the game will receive the updates instantly - no page reload needed.</p>

    <h3>Demo games</h3>
    <p>The content below serves as a demo for the concept and will be updated along the way. While features are added
        continuously, Wasa aims to implement games with the following characteristics at this time: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complex wargames (ie. tries to handle stacks of components, component flipping, rotation etc)</li>
            <li>No hidden informations (ie no decks of cards, no bags with chits, no hidden tokens, no block games)</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h4>Features working</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Draggable markers</li>
                <li>Markers move to top when moved</li>
                <li>Touch support! (Try pinch-zoom and pan on iPad, it looks and feels great!)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h4>Major features currently in development</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple event notification (chat comming first)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Minor features currently in development</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Peek into stacks without generating events (even for observers)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h4>Backlog</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Game component source (ie. game box) - drag from it to create components.</li>
                <li>Game componenent generator script from VASSAL module.</li>
                <li>Saving of game state in backend</li>
                <li>Load of complete game state</li>
                <li>Component move notifications.</li>
                <li>Secure messages by key signing.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>We implement several games in parallel to keep the platform general so the special needs of different games
    can be identified and handled in an ordered fashion.</p>
