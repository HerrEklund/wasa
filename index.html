    <h2>Wasa <small>web based multiplayer board game concept</small></h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="lead">
        Wasa is a concept for a fully online board-game platform. Wasa explores how modern web technologies can enable
        board games to be enjoyed on modern platforms such as touch devices as well as on large-screen PCs.
    </p>

    <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <strong>Disclaimer!</strong> Wasa is not a fully working board game solution. It is a project made to explore
        how real time web-based touch-interface gaming could work. It is a work in process.
    </div>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>What makes Wasa different from other board-game (online or not) solutions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Web based solution - works on any platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile first</strong> - Must work great on touch-screens such as smartphones or iPads</li>
        <li>Quick access - One link to start or continue game.</li>
        <li>Live movements, everything is instantly seen by other players.</li>
        <li>Generic - Wasa focuses on component movement and interactions, less on specific game rules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The draw-back is of course that players must know the rules and there is no automatic score/resource counting etc.</p>

    <h3>Technical stuff</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"Standard" Bootstrap / Jquery(UI) solution</li>
        <li>Websocket event notification for instant and no page refresh experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The backend is based on a Redis database which the HTML5/Javascript client interacts with. The security comes
    from client-side generated Keys to create and find games as well as client side generated public and private key-pairs.</p>

    <p>Game observers can listen for updates by knowing the public key of the game. Only players can update the game
    state using a shared secret game-key. When players update the game state (by moving a piece or rolling a die) they sign
    the events using the private message key (not same as the secret game-key). Other players as well as observers of
    the game will receive the updates instantly - no page reload needed.</p>

    <h3>Demo games</h3>
    <p>The content below serves as a demo for the concept and will be updated along the way. While features are added
        continuously, Wasa aims to implement games with the following characteristics at this time: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complex wargames (ie. tries to handle stacks of components, component flipping, rotation etc)</li>
            <li>No hidden informations (ie no decks of cards, no bags with chits, no hidden tokens, no block games)</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h4>Features working</h4>
            <p>All features are implemented with touch support first in mind (must work great on both PCs and iPads etc.).
            <ul>
                <li>State synchronization between multiple browsers!</li>
                <li>In-game chat.</li>
                <li>Current game history loaded when first entering game.</li>
                <li>Counter move animations.</li>
                <li>Draggable markers.</li>
                <li>Rotatable markers (if enabled and useful).</li>
                <li>Markers move to top when moved.</li>
                <li>Stack selection (select all overlapping).</li>
                <li>Peek into stacks.</li>
                <li>Selectable markers<./li>
                <li>Counter coloring.</li>
                <li>Draggable panels (Tray, game board etc.)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h4>Major features currently in development</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple Game lobby (select or create new private game)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Cool features in investigation or development</h4>
            <ul>

                <li>Offline mode (stack events locally until connection is made)</li>

            <h4>Backlog</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Game component generator script from VASSAL module.</li>
                <li>Secure messages by key signing.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>We implement several games in parallel to keep the platform general so the special needs of different games
    can be identified and handled in an ordered fashion.</p>
